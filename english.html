  <p>
    Thank you for coming today and paying your respects to my mother.
    Your presence, prayers, and kind thoughts mean more to me than words can express.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am truly sorry that I am not able to be there in person today.
    Please know that I carry your support and blessings with deep gratitude in my heart.
    My mother’s life was filled with love, and it brings comfort to know that she
    is remembered and honored by so many.
  </p>
